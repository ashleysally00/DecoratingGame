# Decorate Your Room Game

### by Ashley Rice

## Overview

This is an interactive web-based game where players can decorate a virtual room by arranging various pieces of furniture and decor, primarily comforters and pillows. The game offers a creative, open-ended experience without specific rules or win conditions.

## Game Components

### Decoration Pieces
- The game features 11 different images of room decorations, including comforters and pillows.
- Each decoration piece is positioned on the screen at a specific starting location.

### Game Environment
- The game is set on a webpage where players can freely move the decoration pieces.

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
- Each decoration piece is wrapped in a `<div>` element with a unique ID (pic1, pic2, etc.).
- Absolute positioning is used to place each element at a specific location on the screen.

### Interactivity
- JavaScript is implemented to make the decoration pieces draggable.
- Event listeners are added for both mouse and touch interactions, ensuring compatibility with desktop and mobile devices.

### Dragging Functionality
- When a decoration piece is selected, the game tracks its starting position.
- As the player moves their cursor or finger, the piece's position is updated in real-time.
- Upon release, the decoration piece remains in its new position.

## How to Play

1. Players can drag and drop different comforters, pillows, and other room decorations around the virtual space.
2. There are no specific rules or win conditions - it's an open-ended, creative decoration experience.
3. Players are encouraged to experiment with different layouts and combinations to create their ideal room design.

## Compatibility
