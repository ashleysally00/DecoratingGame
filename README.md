How the Decorate Your Room Game Works

Game Pieces:

The game consists of 11 different images (game pieces) of room decorations, primarily comforters and pillows.
Each decoration piece is placed on the screen at a specific starting position.


HTML Structure:

Each decoration piece is wrapped in a <div> element with a unique ID (pic1, pic2, etc.).
The <div> elements have absolute positioning, allowing them to be placed anywhere on the screen.


Dragging Functionality:

JavaScript is used to make the decoration pieces draggable.
Each piece has two event listeners:

One for mouse interactions (for computers)
One for touch interactions (for mobile devices)




How Dragging Works:

When a user clicks or touches a decoration piece, the game tracks the starting position.
As the user moves their mouse or finger, the game calculates the new position.
The decoration piece is then moved to follow the user's input.
When the user releases the mouse or lifts their finger, the piece stays in its new position.


Game Play:

Players can drag and drop the different comforters, pillows, and other room decorations to create their ideal room layout.
There are no specific rules or win conditions - it's an open-ended, creative decoration experience.


Responsive Design:

The game works on both desktop computers (using mouse events) and touch devices like smartphones or tablets (using touch events).



This simple structure allows for an intuitive and fun game where players can mix and match different room decorations to personalize a virtual space.
